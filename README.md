1. ZstacksToTile_XYZ: Multiple z-stacks are stitched with MATLAB based on the coordinates of the microscope stage. 
2. meanVelocity_motilityCoefficient: 
Mean velocity and motility coefficient of motile cells are calculated based on the information of cell positions according to time. 
Movement of imaging volume is corrected based on the reference positions according to time.
